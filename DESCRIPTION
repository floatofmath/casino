Title: Utility functions for monte carlo simulation and optimization
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Florian", "Klinglmueller", email = "float@lefant.net", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides a number of utility functions that help with
    the conduct of large scale simulation studies. Implemented functions include
    tools to run simulations in parallel, inspect simulation results, and perform
    stochastic optimization.
